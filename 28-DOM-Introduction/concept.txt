he DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. 
It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects, which allows programming 
languages like JavaScript to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage.

How Does the DOM Work?
Building the DOM:

The browser reads the HTML document and creates a corresponding DOM tree structure in memory.
Each tag becomes an element node, and text becomes a text node under the parent element.

Accessing the DOM:

JavaScript can access and manipulate this DOM using the document object.


HTMLCollection
What It Is:

An HTMLCollection is a collection of HTML elements, often returned by methods like getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByClassName(), or children.
It's a live collection, meaning it automatically updates when the DOM changes. If new elements matching the criteria are added or removed, the HTMLCollection updates accordingly.
Key Features:

Live collection: Automatically updates when the DOM changes.
Indexed access: You can access individual elements using an index, similar to an array (htmlCollection[0]).
Not an array: You cannot directly use array methods (like .map(), .filter()) on an HTMLCollection, though you can convert it to an array if needed.
